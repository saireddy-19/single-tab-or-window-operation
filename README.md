This is a Java program using Selenium WebDriver to automate web browser actions. The code navigates to the website "https://publicrecords.netronline.com/", enters "new jersey" into the search field, clicks the "Search" button, clicks on the "New Jersey" link, selects "Burlington" county from the dropdown, and clicks on the "Go to Data Online" link.

After opening the link in a new window, the program switches to the new window and performs a series of actions such as entering a last name, first name, and selecting options from dropdowns. Then it clicks the search button, closes the window, and switches back to the original window.

Finally, the program selects "Georgia" from the state dropdown, waits for 3 seconds, and quits the browser. This program can be used as a starting point for web automation tasks and can be modified to suit different websites and use cases.
